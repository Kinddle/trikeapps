              We are <strong>TrikeApps</strong>.
            </h1>
            <h2> We build developers that know their stuff and websites that are great to use.</h2>
            <p>We employ people from all around the world. We care about your ability and your drive, not your location.</p>
            <p>We are always looking for better ways to keep things humming.</p>
            <p>We are committed to the continuous growth of our people. We want to help the world, and our crew, flourish.</p>
            <p>We custom design and build software to suit precise business needs, solve specific problems, and make our clients money.</p>

          <div class="intuitive">
            <h2>Humane:</h2>
            <p>Computers rock at some things. Humans rock at others. We think that if the two can work together, with software that supports rather than frustrates, you can create productivity magic.</p>
            <h2>Simple (which is different to simple):</h2>
            <p>There's the simple that ignores much of the problem, and then there's the Simple that gives the feeling of simplicity, but with all the capabilities of the complex. We shoot for the second type, which is much harder, but also much more powerful. Our focus on code quality and design helps us move our applications toward Simple, from both the client and the developers' perspective.</p>

            <h2>Evolving:</h2>
            <p>Our development processes are roughly SCRUM-based, but we move quickly to fix the bits that aren't working for us. Our systems and processes are flexible enough to make changes and run different experiments from sprint to sprint.</p>
            <h2>Focused on quality:</h2>
            <p>Our code review and continuous integration processes are geared towards shortening development cycles without compromising the quality of our solutions. We regularly conduct architectural reviews to ensure we're always moving towards our long-term goals. Our close relationship with our clients mean that necessary refactorings get prioritised alongside new features.</p>

          <div class="profitable">
            <h2>Business focused:</h2>
            <p>We offer the most value to our clients when we are sufficiently engaged with their business to kill user stories that will not pay back their development costs; to balance engineering effort with the expected payback time; to ship the features with the biggest cost of delay first. This means real conversations with real people in real time.</p>
            <h2>Empirical:</h2>
            <p>There're lots of theories out there, but lots of them are wrong. Writing code means that our brains have learned to check that our theories and assumptions are right, that they work, and that they match reality.</p>
